all monsters of the opponent. This monster game is based on turn-based RPG games like the famous Pokemon game. However, the normal Pokemon games are only for one player but
this one is an one-on-one game with different gameplay and new features like chat system, monster options or random line up. Player has to pick 3 out of 15 monsters which 
means there are up to 455 ways to pick a team. And each monster will have different stats, skills, faction so the player wants to master this game need a good strategy and
also experience and calculation..
